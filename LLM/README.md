# 🧠 Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)

This repository is based on the book **_Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)_ by Sebastian Raschka (Manning Publications, 2024)**. The book is a hands-on guide to implementing a GPT-style large language model (LLM) using PyTorch — entirely from first principles.

## 📘 About the Book

> Learn how to **build your own LLM step-by-step**, without relying on libraries like Hugging Face Transformers. This book covers everything from data preprocessing, tokenization, and attention mechanisms to training, finetuning, and evaluating generative models.
