# üß† What is TensorFlow?

**TensorFlow** is an open-source end-to-end machine learning framework developed by **Google Brain Team**. It provides a comprehensive platform for building and deploying machine learning and deep learning models across various environments such as servers, edge devices, browsers, and mobile.

* **Initial Release**: November 2015
* **Written in**: Python, C++, CUDA
* **Supported Platforms**: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Web

# üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

### 1. **Tensors**

* **Definition**: Multidimensional arrays representing data.
* Similar to NumPy arrays but optimized for GPU/TPU operations.
* Core building block for all computations in TensorFlow.

### 2. **Computational Graph**

* TensorFlow uses a **dataflow graph model**.
* Nodes represent operations; edges represent tensors.
* Benefits: distributed execution, optimization, and parallelization.

### 3. **Eager Execution**

* Default in TF 2.x (vs. graph mode in TF 1.x).
* Enables imperative programming (like Python).
* Great for debugging and quick prototyping.

# üß± Major Components

### üîπ `tf.Tensor`

* Represents immutable multidimensional arrays.
* Can have different types: `float32`, `int32`, `bool`, etc.

### üîπ `tf.Variable`

* Represents a tensor with mutable state.
* Used for model parameters (weights, biases, etc.).

### üîπ `tf.function`

* Converts Python functions into graph-executed functions.
* Improves performance with TensorFlow‚Äôs AutoGraph system.

# üõ†Ô∏è TensorFlow APIs

### 1. **High-Level API: `tf.keras`**

* Simplified interface for building, training, evaluating models.
* Supports:

  * Prebuilt layers & models
  * Custom training loops
  * Serialization & model saving
  * Callbacks (EarlyStopping, Checkpoint, TensorBoard)

### 2. **Low-Level API**

* For custom ops, control flow, and advanced usage.
* Includes ops like `tf.matmul`, `tf.reduce_mean`, etc.
