# 🔧 What is Autograd in PyTorch?

**Autograd** is PyTorch's automatic differentiation system. It automatically calculates **gradients** (partial derivatives) for **tensor operations**, making it easy to implement and train neural networks.

---

## 📌 Why Is Autograd Important?

In training deep learning models, you:

1. Compute a **loss function** from the output.
2. Use **gradients** to update the model parameters via **gradient descent**.
3. PyTorch's `autograd` automates this gradient calculation step.

---

## ✅ Key Concepts

| Term            | Meaning                                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `requires_grad` | Tells PyTorch to track operations on this tensor.                           |
| `grad`          | Stores the gradient (derivative) of a tensor after `.backward()` is called. |
| `backward()`    | Computes all gradients for the computation graph.                           |
| `grad_fn`       | A function that tracks how the tensor was created.                          |

---

# 🧪 Step-by-Step Example

### 🔹 Step 1: Import and Create Tensor

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
print(x)
```

* `requires_grad=True`: PyTorch will track this tensor for gradient computation.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Perform Operations

```python
y = x * x + 2
print(y)
```

* This creates a new tensor using `x`, and PyTorch builds a **computation graph**.
* `y` is now a function of `x`.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Get a Scalar and Call `.backward()`

```python
z = y.sum()  # Convert vector to scalar (required for backward)
z.backward()
```

* PyTorch computes gradients:
  ∂z/∂x = ∂(x² + 2)/∂x = 2x
  So:

  ```
  x = [2, 3]
  grad = [4, 6]
  ```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Check Gradients

```python
print(x.grad)  # tensor([4., 6.])
```

* You just computed:
  `dz/dx1 = 4`, `dz/dx2 = 6`

---

# 🔁 Behind the Scenes: Computation Graph

Every operation on a tensor creates a **node in a graph**. For example:

```
x → x*x → x*x + 2 → sum → z
```

Calling `.backward()` **traverses** this graph in reverse and computes the gradient.

---

# ✅ Autograd Example with Chain Rule

```python
x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)
y = x ** 3         # y = x³
z = 2 * y + 1      # z = 2x³ + 1
z.backward()       # Compute dz/dx

print(x.grad)      # Should be 6x² = 6 * 4 = 24
```

✔️ Output:

```
tensor(24.)
```

---

## 📌 Notes on `.backward()`

| Situation              | Notes                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| If `z` is a **scalar** | `.backward()` works directly          |
| If `z` is a **vector** | You must provide `gradient=` argument |

---

### 🔸 Vector Output Example

```python
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * x
y.backward(torch.tensor([1.0, 1.0, 1.0]))  # Equivalent to summing gradients
print(x.grad)  # tensor([2.0, 4.0, 6.0])
```

---

## 🔁 Zeroing Gradients

Gradients accumulate by default. You must clear them manually during training.

```python
x.grad.zero_()  # reset gradients to zero
```

---

## 🔐 Disable Gradient Tracking (for inference)

Use `torch.no_grad()` during evaluation or inference to save memory and computation.

```python
with torch.no_grad():
    y = x * 2
```

Or:

```python
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
print(x.requires_grad)  # True

x_detached = x.detach()
print(x_detached.requires_grad)  # False
```

---

# 🧠 Summary: What to Remember

| Concept              | What It Does                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `requires_grad=True` | Tracks operations for gradient             |
| `.backward()`        | Computes gradients                         |
| `.grad`              | Stores computed gradients                  |
| `torch.no_grad()`    | Disables tracking for performance          |
| `.detach()`          | Returns a new tensor without grad tracking |
| `.zero_()`           | Clears gradients                           |

---

## 🧪 Real Example: Linear Regression with Autograd

```python
# y = wx + b (manual implementation)

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
y_true = torch.tensor([2.0, 4.0, 6.0])

w = torch.tensor(0.0, requires_grad=True)

for epoch in range(10):
    y_pred = w * x
    loss = ((y_pred - y_true) ** 2).mean()

    loss.backward()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch}: w = {w.item()}, loss = {loss.item()}")

    # Update
    with torch.no_grad():
        w -= 0.1 * w.grad
        w.grad.zero_()
```

# 📘 PyTorch Autograd Tutorial — Full Documentation

This tutorial walks through:

* Tensor creation with `requires_grad`
* Computation graph
* How PyTorch tracks operations
* Manual gradient calculation (step-by-step)

---

## ✅ Code Overview

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
print("x =", x)

y = x + 2
print("y =", y)

z = y * y * 3
z = z.mean()
print("z =", z)

z.backward()
print("x.grad =", x.grad)
```

---

## 🔍 Explanation of Each Line

---

### 🔹 `x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)`

* Creates a **tensor of shape (3,)** with random values.
* `requires_grad=True` means PyTorch will **track all operations** on `x` to compute gradients later.

> 💡 Use this for any model parameters you want to update via gradient descent.

---

### 🔹 `y = x + 2`

* Element-wise addition.
* Creates a **new tensor** `y`, and PyTorch links it to `x` in the **computation graph**.

> This operation is now tracked in the autograd system.

---

### 🔹 `z = y * y * 3`

* Element-wise:

  ```python
  z_i = 3 * y_i^2
  ```

* Still tracked in computation graph.

---

### 🔹 `z = z.mean()`

* Calculates the average of all elements in `z`.

> At this point, `z` is a **scalar**, and you can call `z.backward()`.

---

### 🔹 `z.backward()`

* **Backpropagation step**: Computes the gradients of `z` with respect to `x`.

> Stores the result in `x.grad`.

---

### 🔹 `print(x.grad)`

* Prints the gradient ∂z/∂x.

---

## 🧠 Computation Graph Overview

```
x → y = x + 2 → z = mean(3 * y²)
```

Autograd builds this graph dynamically as operations occur.

---

## 🧮 Manual Gradient Derivation

We want to compute:

$$
\frac{dz}{dx_i}
$$

Let’s break it down:

### Step 1: Let

$$
y_i = x_i + 2
$$

### Step 2:

$$
z_i = 3 * y_i^2
$$

### Step 3:

$$
z = \frac{1}{3} (z_0 + z_1 + z_2) = \text{mean}
$$

---


---

### ✅ Apply Chain Rule

$$
\frac{dz}{dx_i} = \frac{dz}{dy_i} \cdot \frac{dy_i}{dx_i}
$$

Where:

$$
\frac{dz}{dy_i} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{d(3y_i^2)}{dy_i} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 6y_i = 2y_i
$$

and

$$
\frac{dy_i}{dx_i} = 1
$$

Therefore:

$$
\frac{dz}{dx_i} = 2y_i = 2(x_i + 2)
$$

---



---

## 🔢 Numerical Example

Suppose:

```python
x = tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
```

Then:

* `y = x + 2 = [3.0, 4.0, 5.0]`
* `z = 3 * y^2 = [27.0, 48.0, 75.0]`
* `mean(z) = (27 + 48 + 75)/3 = 150 / 3 = 50.0`

Now:

$$
x.grad = 2 * (x + 2) = 2 * [3, 4, 5] = [6.0, 8.0, 10.0]
$$

✔️ Final gradient:

```python
x.grad = tensor([6., 8., 10.])
```

## 🧾 Summary

| Step                 | Description                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `requires_grad=True` | Enables gradient tracking                     |
| `x + 2`              | Adds a constant (tracked operation)           |
| `* y * 3`            | Element-wise operation                        |
| `.mean()`            | Reduces to scalar (needed for `.backward()`)  |
| `.backward()`        | Triggers automatic gradient calculation       |
| `x.grad`             | Contains gradient of final output w\.r.t. `x` |

---

## ✅ Output Example

```python
x = tensor([1., 2., 3.], requires_grad=True)
y = tensor([3., 4., 5.])
z = tensor(50.0, grad_fn=<MeanBackward0>)
x.grad = tensor([6., 8., 10.])
```

---

## 🔁 What is Autograd?

**Autograd** is PyTorch’s automatic differentiation engine. It automatically computes gradients for tensor operations, which is essential in training neural networks using **gradient descent**.

---

## 🔹 Basics

If you have a tensor with `requires_grad=True`, PyTorch will **track all operations** on it so you can later compute gradients via `backward()`.

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
print(x)
```

---

## 🔸 Build a Computation Graph

Let’s build a simple computation graph:

```python
y = x + 2        # y is a function of x
z = y * y * 3    # z is also a function of x
```

At this point, PyTorch has built a **computation graph**. Now we want to compute the gradient of `z` with respect to `x`.

---

## ❌ Problem: What happens when `z` is **not** a scalar?

```python
print(z)         # Shape: [3]
z.backward()     # ❌ ERROR!
```

### 💥 Error:

```
RuntimeError: grad can be implicitly created only for scalar outputs
```

---

## ✅ Why? `z.backward()` only works if `z` is a **scalar**

PyTorch expects the output of the computation to be a **scalar** (a single number). If it’s not, you need to **tell PyTorch how to reduce it** by giving the gradient of the output manually.

---

## 🧠 Fix 1: Make `z` a scalar

Use `.mean()`, `.sum()`, etc., to turn the output into a scalar:

```python
z = (y * y * 3).mean()
z.backward()       # ✅ Works now
print(x.grad)      # Gradient of scalar z with respect to x
```

---

## 📏 Fix 2: Provide gradient manually (when `z` is a vector)

```python
z = y * y * 3      # z shape: [3]
v = torch.tensor([0.1, 1.0, 0.001])  # same shape as z
z.backward(v)      # ✅ Works
```

Here, you're providing the vector **v** to multiply with **z** during gradient computation:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} (v \cdot z) = \frac{d}{dx} (v_1 z_1 + v_2 z_2 + v_3 z_3)
$$

This dot product is a **scalar**, so PyTorch can compute its gradient.

---

## 📚 Chain Rule & Derivation (Mathematical View)

Let:

* $y_i = x_i + 2$
* $z_i = 3y_i^2$
* $z = \frac{1}{3} \sum_i z_i \Rightarrow \text{(scalar)}$

### ✅ Apply Chain Rule:

$$
\frac{dz}{dx_i} = \frac{dz}{dy_i} \cdot \frac{dy_i}{dx_i}
$$

Where:

$$
\frac{dz}{dy_i} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{d(3y_i^2)}{dy_i} = 2y_i
\quad \text{and} \quad
\frac{dy_i}{dx_i} = 1
$$

So,

$$
\frac{dz}{dx_i} = 2y_i = 2(x_i + 2)
$$

---

## 🔎 Summary

| Case          | Description              | Solution      | `.backward()` works? |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- | -------------------- |
| Scalar output | `z = (y * y * 3).mean()` | Direct call   | ✅ Yes                |
| Vector output | `z = y * y * 3`          | Call with `v` | ✅ Yes                |
| Vector output | No gradient `v`          | Error         | ❌ No                 |

---

## ✅ Best Practice

Always make your final output (like loss) a **scalar**, using `.mean()` or `.sum()`, unless you **know exactly what you're doing** with `v` in `backward()`.

---

## 🧪 Example Code

```python
import torch

# Create input tensor
x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)

# Compute intermediate values
y = x + 2
z = y * y * 3

# Use mean to make it scalar
loss = z.mean()

# Backpropagation
loss.backward()

# Gradients
print("Input x:", x)
print("Gradients:", x.grad)
```

# 📘 PyTorch: Disabling Gradient Tracking

PyTorch’s autograd system automatically tracks operations on tensors with `requires_grad=True`. However, **you don’t always want this**, especially when:

* You’re performing inference (not training).
* You’re working with parts of the model that don’t require gradient updates.
* You want to save memory by not building a computation graph.

---

## ✅ 3 Ways to Disable Gradient Tracking

---

### 🔹 1. `requires_grad_(False)`

You can **in-place modify** a tensor to stop tracking gradients.

```python
x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
print("Before:", x.requires_grad)  # True

x.requires_grad_(False)            # Disable gradient tracking
print("After:", x.requires_grad)   # False
```

🧠 **Effect:** The tensor `x` will now be treated as a regular tensor. No computation using it will be tracked.

---

### 🔹 2. `detach()`

You can create a **new tensor** that shares data with the original but is **disconnected from the computation graph**.

```python
a = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
b = a.detach()
print("a requires_grad:", a.requires_grad)   # True
print("b requires_grad:", b.requires_grad)   # False
```

🧠 **Effect:** The new tensor `b` does **not require gradients**, but still holds the same values as `a`.

🔍 Use case: When you want to **freeze some layers** in a model or avoid gradient tracking for intermediate values.

---

### 🔹 3. `with torch.no_grad():`

This is a **context manager** that disables gradient tracking for all operations inside its block.

```python
m = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)

with torch.no_grad():
    n = m + 2  # No gradient will be tracked for n

print("m requires_grad:", m.requires_grad)   # True
print("n requires_grad:", n.requires_grad)   # False
```

🧠 **Effect:** Any operation inside the `with` block will not be tracked by autograd. It’s the most **recommended way** during inference or evaluation.

---

## 🧪 Summary Table

| Method                  | Description                                          | Applied To   | Result                                   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `requires_grad_(False)` | In-place modification of tensor to disable gradients | A tensor     | Tensor won’t track gradients             |
| `detach()`              | Create a new tensor detached from computation graph  | A tensor     | New tensor shares data, but no gradients |
| `with torch.no_grad()`  | Context manager to disable tracking globally         | A code block | No operations inside are tracked         |

---

## 🔐 Use Cases

* **Model evaluation/inference:**

  ```python
  model.eval()
  with torch.no_grad():
      output = model(input)
  ```

* **Freezing part of a model:**

  ```python
  for param in model.backbone.parameters():
      param.requires_grad = False
  ```

* **Temporary tensor operations that shouldn't affect gradients:**

  ```python
  x = model(input)
  y = x.detach()  # Use y in some logging or post-processing
  ```

---

Here's a **complete documentation** with **manual calculation** of the given PyTorch code using `autograd` to compute gradients through **multiple backward passes**, including why and how gradients accumulate, and how `.zero_()` is used.

---

## 🔍 **Code Overview**

```python
import numpy as np
import torch

weights = torch.ones(4, requires_grad=True)

for i in range(3):
    model_outputs = (weights * 3).sum()
    model_outputs.backward()
    print(weights.grad)
    weights.grad.zero_()  # Reset gradients to zero for the next iteration
```

---

## 📘 **Step-by-Step Explanation**

### ✅ 1. Initialize weights

```python
weights = torch.ones(4, requires_grad=True)
```

This creates a tensor:

```python
weights = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
```

And tells PyTorch to track all operations on `weights` for gradient calculation.

---

### ✅ 2. Forward Pass

```python
model_outputs = (weights * 3).sum()
```

Let’s break it down:

* Multiply each element by 3: `[1*3, 1*3, 1*3, 1*3] = [3, 3, 3, 3]`
* Take the sum: `3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12`

So, for each iteration:

```python
model_outputs = 12.0  (scalar)
```

This is a **scalar function**, so `backward()` can be called directly.

---

### ✅ 3. Backward Pass (Autograd)

We compute:

```math
\frac{d(model\_outputs)}{d(weights)} = \frac{d(\sum 3 \cdot weights_i)}{d(weights)} = [3, 3, 3, 3]
```

Let’s manually derive the gradient for each element `wᵢ` of `weights`.

### 🔢 Manual Gradient Calculation:

Let:

* $f(w) = 3w_1 + 3w_2 + 3w_3 + 3w_4 = 3 \cdot \sum w_i$

Then:

* $\frac{df}{dw_i} = 3$ for each $i$

So the gradient is:

```python
[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]
```

---

### ✅ 4. Gradient Accumulation and `zero_()`

PyTorch **accumulates gradients** by default. So, without this line:

```python
weights.grad.zero_()
```

the gradients from previous iterations would be **added** (accumulated) like:

```
Iteration 1: [3, 3, 3, 3]
Iteration 2: [6, 6, 6, 6]
Iteration 3: [9, 9, 9, 9]
```

To avoid that, we **reset gradients to zero** using:

```python
weights.grad.zero_()
```

So that each backward pass gives a **clean, non-accumulated gradient** result.

---

## 🔁 Full Output

Expected output from the code:

```
tensor([3., 3., 3., 3.])
tensor([3., 3., 3., 3.])
tensor([3., 3., 3., 3.])
```

 **complete tutorial** for the provided PyTorch code using the **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer**. We’ll explain **what each line does**, and correct and clarify the behavior, especially around `optimizer.step()` and gradient computation.

---

## ✅ Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import torch

# Step 1: Initialize weights with gradient tracking
weights = torch.ones(4, requires_grad=True)

# Step 2: Define an optimizer (SGD) for updating weights
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD([weights], lr=0.01)

# Step 3: Compute a dummy loss (for example purposes)
output = (weights * 3).sum()  # Simple scalar output
output.backward()  # Compute gradients (∂output/∂weights)

# Step 4: Perform one step of optimization (weight update)
optimizer.step()

# Step 5: Zero out gradients for the next iteration
optimizer.zero_grad()

# Step 6: Inspect the weights and gradients
print("Updated Weights:", weights)
print("Gradients after zero_grad():", weights.grad)
```

---

## 📘 Step-by-Step Explanation

### 🔹 Step 1: `requires_grad=True`

```python
weights = torch.ones(4, requires_grad=True)
```

This creates a tensor:

```
[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
```

and tells PyTorch to **track gradients** through any operation applied to `weights`.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Define the Optimizer

```python
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD([weights], lr=0.01)
```

You create an **SGD optimizer** with learning rate `0.01`. The optimizer needs a list of parameters (`[weights]`) it should update during training.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Define a Loss Function & Backward Pass

```python
output = (weights * 3).sum()
output.backward()
```

#### 🔢 Manual Gradient:

Let’s calculate gradient:

* Output = `3*w1 + 3*w2 + 3*w3 + 3*w4 = 3 * sum(weights)`
* Gradient: `∂output/∂wi = 3`

So:

```python
weights.grad = [3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]
```

This is computed by:

```python
output.backward()
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Optimizer Step

```python
optimizer.step()
```

This **updates the weights** using the formula:

```python
weights = weights - learning_rate * grad
```

So:

```
weights = [1, 1, 1, 1] - 0.01 * [3, 3, 3, 3]
         = [0.97, 0.97, 0.97, 0.97]
```

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Reset Gradients

```python
optimizer.zero_grad()
```

PyTorch **accumulates gradients** by default. So before the next `.backward()` call, you need to **zero out** old gradients.

After this line:

```python
weights.grad = None or [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0] (depending on version/settings)
```

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Print Results

```python
print("Updated Weights:", weights)
print("Gradients after zero_grad():", weights.grad)
```

---

## ❌ What Was Wrong in Your Original Code?

In your original code, you called:

```python
optimizer.step()
```

**before** computing the gradients with `.backward()`. That means the optimizer **had no gradients to apply**, so weights stayed unchanged.

Also, calling `weights.grad` before `.backward()` will return `None`.

---

## ✅ Correct Order of Operations:

1. Compute prediction
2. Compute loss
3. Call `.backward()` to compute gradients
4. Call `.step()` to update parameters
5. Call `.zero_grad()` to reset gradients for next iteration

---

## 🔁 Final Output:

```
Updated Weights: tensor([0.9700, 0.9700, 0.9700, 0.9700], requires_grad=True)
Gradients after zero_grad(): tensor([0., 0., 0., 0.])
```
